      <h2>Coaching</h2>
      <br/>
      <h5>BELONGING</h5>
      <h6>THE SOCIAL DIMENSION OF COACHING</h6>
      A need of belonging and attachment is universal. It does not matter if we are women or men, healthy or not, part of a minority or a majority, rich or poor, young or old. Everyone needs a space where we feel respected, included, and supported. Belonging
      to a family, work team, to our city, rooting for a sport team, are ways of being connected. It is Emotica’s mission to increase this sense of connection for those who find this basic need unmet. This is why we promote inclusion, because as long as
      the inter population relationships increase, the sense of being socially connected delivers the best to us and to our surroundings.<br/>
      <br/> “Our premise is that inclusion leads to gowth. So for those who are locked out, they lose development, and those are in power lose market and growth”
      <br/> Jesse Jackson<br/>
      <br/>
      <h5>EMPOWER YOURSELF</h5>
      Are you a fish?<br/> Since we were born we have shaped our lives to a pre-defined model. We adjust to our parents, to our friends, to our partner, to our job description. Sometimes we feel like the fish that was asked to climb a tree, we find ourselves
      inadequate, frustrated, angered or overwhelmed. Never good enough? But the question is, are you really a fish?<br/><br/> Knowing what we are, or want, or need, or feel, despite other opinions, gives us the power and the control on our lives and
      ourselves. It is the road to feel valuable for what we do, appreciated for what we shared, loved for what we already are.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h5>PICTURE YOUR OBJECTIVE</h5>
      Emotica is a Life Coach company, but not a common one. We use Photography, automatic writing, music and other ways to look into ourselves, to express unspeakable feelings, to communicate with others.<br/> Have you ever questioned why it is so easy
      to take a selfie and so uncomfortable to pose for a picture?<br/> Why can a song provoke a myriad of emotions, trigger feelings, dreams, fears or unspeakable needs?<br/> Let's explore the journey together in a more resourceable and creative way.<br/>      It is about yourself. Your way.
